# Mundus ![Java CI workflow](https://github.com/JamesTKhan/Mundus/actions/workflows/gradle.yml/badge.svg)
Mundus is a platform independent 3D world editor, built with Java, Kotlin and LibGDX + VisUI. You can
create your scenes in Mundus and then use the Mundus runtime to render and interact with
those scenes in a libGDX project. See [runtime usage](https://github.com/JamesTKhan/Mundus/wiki/Runtime-usage)
for an example. You can see current milestones for
releases on the [milestones](https://github.com/JamesTKhan/Mundus/milestones) page.

This project is at a very early stage in development and APIs may be missing basic features. Create an issue
if you notice something important that is missing.

## Current features
Below are some of the more interesting features, that already work

- Creation of multiple terrains
- Height map loader for terrains
- Procedural terrain generation
- Texture splatting for the terrain texture (max 5 textures per terrain)
- A complete terrain editing system with texture & height brushes
- 4 different brushes (brush form can be an arbitrary image, like in Blender or Gimp)
- 3 brush modes for each brush: Raise/Lower, Flatten & texture paint
- Custom implementation of [gdx-gltf](https://github.com/mgsx-dev/gdx-gltf) PBR shader for model rendering
- Water quads with reflections, refractions, foam, and customizable ripples
- Static Skyboxes with support for multiple skyboxes
- Loading of g3db/gltf/glb files. GLTF is the recommended format.
- Loading of obj/fbx/dae files (note, that the [fbx-conv](https://github.com/libgdx/fbx-conv) binary must be set in the settings)
- Visual translation, rotation tool, and scaling tools 
- Multiple scenes in one project
- Full screen preview mode
- A component based scene graph (not fully implemented yet)
- Basic export of the project into a json format + asset (not needed for libGDX runtime)
- Undo/Redo system for most operations
- Highly accurate game object picking system, based on id color coding & offscreen framebuffer rendering.

## LibGDX discord channel for Mundus

If you need help with Mundus go to the libGDX discord at: https://libgdx.com/community/discord/ 
and then go to **libraries/Mundus** thread under the **SPECIFIC TOPICS** section.

## Things to consider
- Mundus is constantly changing. Especially the internal representation of save files. At this stage of the project backwards compatability
is kept between minor changes, and I keep backwards compatability in mind for major version changes, but it is not guaranteed as the APIs are still
being developed.
- Depending on your keyboard layout some key shortcuts might be twisted (especially CTRL+Z and CTRL+Y for QWERTZ and QWERTY layouts) 
because of the default GLFW keycode mapping. You can change the layout mapping in the settings dialog under Window -> Settings.

## Runtime
The only runtime being developed is for libGDX, which is included in this repository. See [runtime usage](https://github.com/JamesTKhan/Mundus/wiki/Runtime-usage)
for an example.
Runtimes for other engines/frameworks are not planned in the near futures.
